# Formalising Mathematics

My solutions and projects for M60040 - Formalising Mathematics at Imperial College London, lectured by Prof. Kevin Buzzard.

This is a fork of ImperialCollegeLondon/formalising-mathematics-2022, which contains all the problem sheets without the solutions.

Lecture videos are [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XaL0tjnWSk&list=PLVZep5wTamMmRPvCLO4WVpCwkTi1F6OyF) and course notes are [here](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/formalising-mathematics-2022/).
